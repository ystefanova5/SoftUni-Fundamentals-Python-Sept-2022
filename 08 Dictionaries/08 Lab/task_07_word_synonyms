# 07. Word Synonyms
# Task Description:
# Write a program, which keeps a dictionary with synonyms. 
# The key of the dictionary will be the word. 
# The value will be a list of all the synonyms of that word. 
# You will be given a number n – the count of the words. 
# After each term, you will be given a synonym, so the count of lines you should read from the console is 2 * n. 
# You will be receiving a word and a synonym each on a separate line like this:
# • {word}
# • {synonym}
# If you get the same word twice, just add the new synonym to the list. 
# Print the words in the following format:
# {word} - {synonym1, synonym2 … synonymN}
