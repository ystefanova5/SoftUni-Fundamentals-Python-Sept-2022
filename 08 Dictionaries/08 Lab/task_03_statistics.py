# 03. Statistics
# Task Description:
# You will be receiving key-value pairs on separate lines separated by ": "
# until you receive the command "statistics". Sometimes you may receive a product more than once.
# In that case, you have to add the new quantity to the existing one.
# When you receive the "statistics" command, print the following:
# "Products in stock:
# - {product1}: {quantity1}
# - {product2}: {quantity2}
# â€¦
# - {productN}: {quantityN}
# Total Products: {count_all_products}
# Total Quantity: {sum_all_quantities}"
